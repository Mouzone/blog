>One emperor threatened to exile the patriarch if he did not stop condemning popular sins. The saint responded:
>
>**“You cannot exile me, for the whole world is my Father's house.”**
>
>When threatened with death, he replied:  
**“You cannot kill me, for my life is hidden with Christ in God.”**
>
>When the emperor said he would confiscate all his wealth:  
**“My treasure is in heaven, and my heart is there.”**
>
>And finally, when threatened with the loss of all his friends:  
**“You cannot take them either, for I have a Friend in heaven from whom you cannot separate me. I will not stop preaching the Gospel. There is nothing you can do to hurt me.”**
