If you subscribe to church culture, _fellowship_ is often described as any gathering of church members. It’s a tagline applied to everything from serving in ministries to playing on a church soccer team. While I accept it can be a valid term for some occasions, I believe we must ground ourselves in the Bible and remind ourselves what **God-centered** fellowship truly is.

We have confused fellowship with simply being with friends. It’s a common mistake—after all, how can you have fellowship if you don’t even like the people enough to be friends? But when we look deeper into God’s Word, we find the key distinction: whether the people you are with are **believers**. And I don’t mean believers in the sense of church attendance or activity, but believers in the Spirit—those who are truly walking with God.

Identifying whether someone believes can be a tricky task. However, identifying a good, God-centered Christian community is much simpler. Luke writes in _Acts_:

> <sup>42</sup>They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup>43</sup>Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. <sup>44</sup>All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup>45</sup>They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.  <sup>46</sup>Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup>47</sup>praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.  
> —**Acts 2:42–47 (NIV)**

Reading this, we must look at the gathering as a whole. The characteristics of God-centered fellowship include a **pursuit of holiness**. They served together and were united in their care for the poor and needy. They met regularly and lived their lives in community. Most importantly—more than just being glad and sincere—they **praised God**.

So it is foolish to call a gathering of lukewarm believers _fellowship_ when this was the standard set by the original apostles. We can call it a _hangout_, but fellowship implies a different standard—one that the world has scarcely seen.

If the word itself doesn’t convince you, look at the very last sentence of that passage:  
**"And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved."**

I believe this points back to what John wrote:

> <sup>23</sup>I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.  
> —**John 17:23 (NIV)**

This shows that when our fellowship is pure, the world will take notice and be drawn in. But to achieve this unity, we as individuals must first **abide in God**. From that abiding, true fellowship will take root.

So desire more for your church community. This kind of blessed fellowship is not only for God to glorify Himself through His people—it will also bring **gladness** to your heart.

**So ask yourself:**
- Are you receiving fellowship?
- Do you feel like you are serving alone?
- Do you feel like you are in a space to share and hear the goodness of God regularly with those around you?
- Are you receiving and giving prayers to your brothers and sisters?
- Are you thankful for the people around you?
- Does it light a fire in your heart to praise God?
- Has your fellowship changed the lives of those around you?
